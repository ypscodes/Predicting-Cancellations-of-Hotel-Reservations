# Predicting Cancellations of Hotel Reservations

In this hotel reservations project, we will develop a machine learning model that can forecast whether or not a certain reservation made by a user will be canceled.  

In this project, we will commence with collecting and segregating pertinent datasets.  Followed by basic and advanced data analysis, furthermore, applying the concepts of machine learning to build a functional and optimized machine learning model. 

Some of the domains and platforms where this project can be applied are online traveling and reservation platforms such as MakeMyTrip, GoIbibo, EaseMyTrip, Airbnb, Oyo, Booking.com, Yatra, Expedia, Agoda, etc. All such platforms shall benefit from this model to predict and project the cancellation of reservations that have been made by the customers. 

All of these platforms may anticipate an increase in income by reducing the probability of hotel cancellation with the use of this data science and machine learning initiative.
